# Agentic Workspace API

HTTP/SSE API of the workspace backend (`src/api/routers/workspace.py` +
`src/core/workspace/service.py`, request/response models in
`src/api/schemas/workspace.py`). It serves the three-pane workspace UI —
chat, directory tree, file editor — as part of the main
biocypher-components-registry FastAPI app, alongside the registration and
registry routes under `/api/v1`.

All workspace routes live under a configurable prefix, default:

```
/agent/api/v1
```

kept distinct from the registry's `/api/v1` prefix (`settings.api_v1_prefix`)
so the workspace routes can sit behind the registry's nginx unchanged.
Override with the `AGENT_API_PREFIX` env var.

Run the server (from the repo root):

```bash
uv sync
uv run uvicorn src.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

This is the same process and command that serves `/api/v1/...`; there is no
separate workspace service to run.

## Interactive docs (Swagger)

FastAPI serves the generated OpenAPI docs automatically — with the server
running, open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` — Swagger UI (interactive, try-it-out)
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` — ReDoc (read-only)
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json` — raw OpenAPI schema

Workspace routes are grouped under the `workspace` tag, alongside `health`,
`adapters`, `metadata`, `registrations`, and `registry`. Each route's error
status codes (401/409/428/…) are documented in the generated schema and
match the tables in this file.

Two caveats when trying routes out in Swagger UI:

1. Workspace routes require the registry GitHub session cookie. For
   `/sessions/{id}/...` requests, also provide the `authorization` field with
   `Bearer <session_token>` — the word `Bearer`, a space, then the token from
   `POST /sessions` — or put the bare token in the `token` query field.
2. Do not execute `GET .../events` from Swagger UI: it is an infinite SSE
   stream and the UI waits for the response to complete. Use `curl -N` (see
   the example below) or the frontend's SSE reader instead.

## Security model — read before deploying

**Run this service only inside the hardened container.** Sessions expose a
`run_command` tool to the model: arbitrary shell in the server's context. The
path confinement on file tools and file routes does *not* apply to shell
commands — on a bare host, a prompt-injected turn can read anything the
server's user can read and exfiltrate it. The docker-compose setup (read-only
root, non-root user, cap-drop, resource limits) is the intended boundary;
per-session sibling containers are the multi-tenant answer (deployment.md).

Consequences of the current single-process design:

- **Sessions are not isolated from each other at the shell level.** File
  tools and file routes are confined per workspace, but one session's
  `run_command` can read another session's workspace directory. Acceptable
  for a single-user demo; multi-tenant use requires per-session containers.
- **Session allocation is authenticated but uncapped.** Any signed-in user can
  create sessions (each: MCP connection + directory + task), and there is still
  no request-body limit or workspace disk quota.
- **Todo for sessions/requests**: Front nginx with rate limits,
  set `client_max_body_size`, and monitor disk usage before wider deployment.
- **TLS is a deployment requirement, not built in.** The BYOK key travels in
  a request body and the session token in a header; both need HTTPS
  termination (nginx) on anything but localhost. The `?token=` query form
  additionally lands in access logs — prefer the `Authorization` header via
  a `fetch()`-based SSE reader; reserve `?token=` for quick local debugging.

## Concepts

A **session** is one workspace: its own directory on disk, its own MCP
connection, its own conversation history, and its own user-supplied Anthropic
credential (BYOK). Sessions are independent; deleting a session destroys all
of it.

A **turn** is one user message plus everything the agent does in response
(thinking, tool calls, file edits, shell commands) until it produces its final
answer. Turns are serialized per session — one at a time.

The model only ever sees truncated tool results (`MCP_RESULT_MAX_CHARS`,
default 20000); full results stay in the backend. SSE events carry at most a
500-char preview of each tool result.

Two knowable limits: conversation history grows unbounded with the session
(memory server-side, input tokens per turn — prompt caching softens the cost
but not the growth), so prefer fresh sessions over very long ones. And
`turn_error`/`session_error` messages contain raw exception text; they are
only delivered to the session's own event stream.

## Authentication

`POST /sessions` requires the registry GitHub auth cookie and returns a
`session_token`. Every `/sessions/{id}/...` request requires that same GitHub
user plus the workspace token, either as

```
Authorization: Bearer <session_token>
```

or as a `?token=<session_token>` query parameter. The query form exists for
browser-native `EventSource`, which cannot set headers; prefer the header (a
`fetch()`-based SSE reader can set it).

Unknown session ids, wrong users, and wrong tokens all return **401** with the
same body, so session ids and ownership cannot be enumerated.

## Endpoints

### Session lifecycle

#### `POST /sessions`

Creates a session: allocates the workspace directory and opens the MCP
connection.

- **201**
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "e53d64ad54dc43f0aa3e321dc7f0f7d4",
    "session_token": "i_sFZ6s1NAoBB...",
    "model": "claude-opus-4-8",
    "tools": [
      {"name": "get_available_workflows", "description": "Main entry point tool ..."},
      {"name": "write_file", "description": "Create or overwrite a text file with the given content."}
    ]
  }
  ```
- **401** — GitHub sign-in is required(to start a session). The frontend prompts the user to sign in first too.
This is the same as the normal application authentication and differs from the 401 that is returned on other agentic
workspace routes, where 401 means the session workspace key is invalid instead.
- **502** — the MCP server could not be reached (session is not created).

The `session_token` is shown exactly once; store it client-side for the
session's lifetime.

#### `GET /sessions/{id}`

Session state — useful after a reconnect.

- **200**
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "e53d...",
    "model": "claude-opus-4-8",
    "has_key": true,
    "busy": false,
    "error": null,
    "tools": [ ... ]
  }
  ```

`error` is non-null when the session's MCP connection died; such a session
only serves file routes and should be deleted.

#### `DELETE /sessions/{id}`

Ends the session: closes the MCP connection, drops the history, deletes the
workspace directory, forgets the key.

- **204**

### Key upload (BYOK)

#### `POST /sessions/{id}/key`

Attach the user's Anthropic credential to the session. The UI collects it in
the chat pane (masked input) but **must** send it here — never as a chat
message; anything in a chat message enters model context, history, and
provider logs. The backend holds the key in memory only and destroys it with
the session.

Body — one of:

```json
{"api_key": "sk-ant-..."}
{"auth_token": "<bearer token, e.g. for a gateway>"}
```

- **204** — stored.
- **400** — neither field given.

Calling it again replaces the credential.

### Chat

#### `POST /sessions/{id}/messages`

Append a user turn and start the tool loop. Returns immediately; progress
arrives on the events stream.

Body:

```json
{"content": "Create a BioCypher adapter for UniProt."}
```

- **202** — `{"turn_id": "1f0c..."}`
- **400** — empty `content`.
- **409** — a turn is already running; wait for `turn_done`/`turn_error`.
- **428** — no key set yet (`POST .../key` first).
- **502** — session unusable (MCP connection died).

If the turn fails mid-way (provider error, interrupt), the whole partial turn
is rolled back from history — the user simply retries.

#### `POST /sessions/{id}/interrupt`

Cancel the running turn (or a turn that was accepted but has not started
yet). History rolls back to the pre-turn snapshot and a `turn_error` event
with message `"interrupted"` is emitted.

- **202** — `{"status": "interrupting"}`
- **409** — no turn is running or queued.

#### `GET /sessions/{id}/events`

Server-sent events stream (`text/event-stream`). The first event is always a
snapshot:

```
event: session_state
data: {"has_key": false, "busy": false, "error": null}
```

then live events follow, each with an incrementing `id:`:

```
event: text_delta
id: 42
data: {"text": "Let me check the available workflows."}
```

A comment line `: heartbeat` is sent after 15 idle seconds to keep proxies
from closing the stream.

| Event | Data | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `session_state` | `{has_key, busy, error}` | snapshot on (re)connect |
| `turn_started` | `{turn_id}` | turn accepted by the worker |
| `thinking_started` | `{}` | model is in a thinking block (show a marker) |
| `text_delta` | `{text}` | assistant text, streamed |
| `tool_call` | `{name, args}` | the model invoked a tool (render as a chip) |
| `tool_result` | `{name, is_error, chars, preview}` | tool finished; `preview` is the first 500 chars, `chars` the full length that entered model context |
| `usage` | `{input, cache_read, cache_write, output}` | token usage of one API call within the turn |
| `fs_changed` | `{paths}` | workspace changed (agent write/edit, any `run_command` — empty-string path means "anything may have changed" — or an editor `PUT`); refresh the tree and open files |
| `turn_done` | `{turn_id}` | turn finished; the session accepts the next message |
| `turn_error` | `{turn_id, message}` | turn failed or was interrupted; history rolled back |
| `session_error` | `{message}` | MCP connection died; session is unusable |
| `session_closed` | `{}` | session was deleted; the stream ends after this event |

Multiple subscribers are allowed (e.g. two browser tabs); events are fanned
out to all of them. There is no replay — connect to the stream before sending
messages — and the `id:` field is informational only (`Last-Event-ID` on
reconnect is not honored). Each subscriber buffers at most 1000 events; a
consumer that stalls longer than that loses the oldest events.

### Files (directory pane + editor)

All `path` parameters are relative to the session workspace. Absolute paths
and `..` are rejected with **400**; symlink escapes are blocked server-side.

#### `GET /sessions/{id}/files?path=<dir>`

List one directory level (directories first, then files, both sorted).
Omit `path` (or pass `""`) for the workspace root.

- **200**
  ```json
  {
    "path": "",
    "entries": [
      {"name": "adapter", "path": "adapter", "is_dir": true},
      {"name": "README.md", "path": "README.md", "is_dir": false}
    ]
  }
  ```
- **404** — not a directory.

Build the tree by fetching levels lazily as the user expands them.

#### `GET /sessions/{id}/file?path=<file>`

- **200** — `{"path": "a.txt", "content": "...", "etag": "\"c8bfeab3...\""}`
- **404** — no such file.
- **415** — not a text file.

Keep the `etag`; the editor sends it back on save.

#### `PUT /sessions/{id}/file?path=<file>`

Create or overwrite a file. Parent directories are created as needed.

Body: `{"content": "..."}`. Optional header: `If-Match: <etag>`.

- **200** — `{"path": "a.txt", "etag": "<new etag>"}`
- **409** — `If-Match` given and the file changed since it was loaded (the
  agent or another editor wrote it), or the file was deleted, or the path is
  a directory. Re-fetch, show a conflict banner, let the user decide.

Send `If-Match` when saving an opened file; omit it when creating a new one.
A successful `PUT` also emits `fs_changed` to all event subscribers.

Filesystem errors (a parent path component is an existing file, permissions)
also return **409** with the OS error message. The `If-Match` check is atomic
against the agent's file tools, but not against a shell command
(`run_command`) writing the same file at the same instant — a lost update
there is theoretically possible and surfaces as the next `fs_changed`.

#### `DELETE /sessions/{id}/file?path=<path>`

Delete a file or directory (recursively).

- **204** — deleted (emits `fs_changed`).
- **400** — refusing to delete the workspace root.
- **404** — no such file or directory.

## Configuration (env vars)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_API_PREFIX` | `/agent/api/v1` | route prefix (registry nginx convention) |
| `AGENT_WORKSPACES_ROOT` | `./workspaces` | parent dir of per-session workspaces (`/app/data/workspaces` in the compose stacks) |
| `AGENT_SESSION_READY_TIMEOUT` | `30` | seconds to wait for MCP on session create |
| `BIOCYPHER_MCP_URL` | `https://mcp.biocypher.org/mcp` | MCP server |
| `BIOCYPHER_MCP_AUTH_HEADER[_FILE]` | — | MCP auth header, read once at service start |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-8` | model for all sessions |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | — | Anthropic-compatible endpoint (LiteLLM, llama.cpp) |
| `CLAUDE_THINKING` | auto | `adaptive`/`off` override |
| `MCP_RESULT_MAX_CHARS` | `20000` | tool-result cap before model context |

Note: the Anthropic key is *not* configured via environment — each session
receives its own key through `POST .../key`.

## Example: full session with curl

```bash
B=http://127.0.0.1:8000/agent/api/v1

# 1. create a session
CREATED=$(curl -s -X POST $B/sessions)
SID=$(echo "$CREATED" | jq -r .session_id)
TOK=$(echo "$CREATED" | jq -r .session_token)
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $TOK"

# 2. watch events (separate terminal)
curl -sN "$B/sessions/$SID/events?token=$TOK"

# 3. upload the key, then chat
curl -s -X POST $B/sessions/$SID/key -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"api_key": "sk-ant-..."}' -o /dev/null
curl -s -X POST $B/sessions/$SID/messages -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "What BioCypher workflows are available?"}'

# 4. browse and edit the workspace
curl -s "$B/sessions/$SID/files" -H "$AUTH"
curl -s -X PUT "$B/sessions/$SID/file?path=notes.md" -H "$AUTH" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content": "# Notes"}'

# 5. clean up
curl -s -X DELETE $B/sessions/$SID -H "$AUTH"
```
